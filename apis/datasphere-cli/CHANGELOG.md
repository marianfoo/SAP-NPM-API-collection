# Changelog

All notable changes to this project SAP Datasphere Command-Line Interface (DS CLI) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2024.2.0

### Fixed

- The `--browser` option introduced with version `2024.1.0` did not apply the default correctly in case the option `--browser` was not explicitly specified.

## 2024.1.0

### Added

- A check for the correct node version environment when using the CLI. In case the node version does not satisfy the minimum node version required by the CLI to function correctly, a warning is printed to the console.

- When printing the help information for the `login` command, the list of options now includes the login-specific options such as `--authorization-url` and `--token-url`. Previously the help showed the following options:

  ```bash
  <CLI> login --help
  Usage: <CLI> login [options]
  log in to your account using interactive OAuth authentication
  Options:
    -H, --host <host>  specifies the url where the tenant is hosted (optional)
    -h, --help         display help for command
  ```

  With this version, the help looks like this:

  ```bash
  <CLI> login --help
  Usage: <CLI> login [options]
  log in to your account using interactive OAuth authentication
  Options:
    -H, --host <host>              specifies the url where the tenant is hosted (optional)
    -A, --authorization-url <url>  authorization url for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -t, --token-url <url>          token url for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -c, --client-id <id>           client id for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -C, --client-secret <secret>   client secret for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -a, --access-token <token>     access token for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -b, --code <code>              code for oauth token retrieval (optional)
    -r, --refresh-token <token>    refresh token for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -s, --secrets-file <file>      path to secrets file (optional)
    -h, --help                     display help for command
  Only command-specific options are listed here. To learn more about available generic options, visit https://tinyurl.com/yck8vv4w
  ```

- Added the option `--browser <browser>` to the login command. Users can now choose explicitly which browser to open when logging in to a tenant. By default the system's default browser is used.

### Fixed

- The HTTPS proxy support introduced with `2023.24.0` did not respect the underlying `axios` module configuration need to disable the native proxy handling by passing `proxy: false` to the request configuration.

### Changed

- Previously, when running the `logout` command but no secrets existed anymore, the command would fail with exit code 1 and an error message. Now, when running the `logout` command but there are no secrets to logout from, the command fails silently.

## 2023.25.0

### Fixed

- The defined HTTP protocol was not applied to calculated authorization URL and token URL. No matter which HTTP protocol (`http` or `https`) was used, the automatically calculated authorization URL and token URL always used the `https` protocol.

### Added

- HTTPS proxy support via environment variable `https_proxy`. When using an HTTPS proxy to communicate with the public internet, you can configure the environment variable `https_proxy`. The CLI uses the value from the environment variable to establish a correct connection to the HTTPS proxy.

- Support for response header `x-sap-datasphere-cli-file-name`. When the user adds option `--output` and provides a path to a file location, this value is always used to store the response data, no matter whether response header `x-sap-datasphere-cli-file-name` is present. If the user adds option `--output` without providing a path to a file location and the response header `x-sap-datasphere-cli-file-name` is present, the response data is stored in the location mentioned in `x-sap-datasphere-cli-file-name`. In all other cases, the response data is printed to the console.

## 2023.24.0

### Fixed

- Trailing single quotes (`'`) were removed from option values even though there was no leading single quote. This version contains a fix that trailing single quotes are only removed if there is a leading single quote.

  Trailing single quote is not removed: `some 'value'` stays `some 'value'`.

  Trailing single quote is removed: `'some value'` becomes `some value`.

- The help output did not mention the correct CLI name. Instead the output showed the name 'terminal'.

  ```javascript
  Usage: terminal [options] [command]

  Command-Line Interface for SAP Datasphere.
  ...
  ```

  Since this version, the name is shown correctly.

  ```javascript
  Usage: datasphere [options] [command]

  Command-Line Interface for SAP Datasphere.
  ...
  ```

## 2023.19.0

### Added

- Support for managing multiple logins/secrets for different tenants in parallel. The `datasphere login` and `datasphere logout` commands have been updated, allowing you to login to multiple tenants in parallel. When running a command, the CLI uses the secret matching the currently maintained tenant URL via the `-H, --host` option or set via `datasphere config host set <host>`. You now must specify the host which you are logging in to using option `-H, --host`, or by setting the host globally first by calling `datasphere config host set <host>`, to allow the CLI to store the secret for the defined tenant URL.

  You can list all locally stored secrets by running `datasphere config secrets show`.

  ```javascript
  $ datasphere config secrets show
  [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "client_id": "sb-0d85e619...",
      "client_secret": "1dcc0522-...",
      "tenantUrl": "https://somehost.eu10.cloud.sap",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "client_id": "sb-0d85e619...",
      "client_secret": "1dcc0522-...",
      "tenantUrl": "https://somehost.us10.cloud.sap",
      ...
    }
  ]
  ```

  In order to logout again, the `datasphere logout` command allows you to optionally specify the ID of the login/secret to remove using option `-l, --login-id <id>`.

  ```javascript
  datasphere logout --help
  Usage: datasphere logout [options]

  log out from your account

  Options:
    -l, --login-id <id>  specifies the login ID (optional) (choices: "0", default: "0")
    -h, --help           display help for command
  ```

  By default, when you omit option `-l, --login-id <id>`, the login/secret with ID _0_ is removed.

  You cannot login to the same tenant with different _access tokens_ at the same time. There can only be a single login/secret per tenant, but you can login into multiple tenants in parallel. If you need to login with different users into the same tenant, you have to logout first, then login again with a different user.

- Support for predefined OAuth clients where the client ID _does not_ start with the term `sb-`. When using a predefined OAuth client where the client ID _does not_ start with the term `sb-`, the CLI uses a different default port `65000` to retrieve the temporary code to retrieve the access token and refresh token. The port can be changed using the environment variable mentioned in the [README.md](README.md) file.

- Improved OAuth authorization URL and token URL support. You do not have to specify the options for the _OAuth Client Authorization URL_ and _Token URL_ anymore, if you specify the tenant URL using the _-H, --host_ option. The CLI calculates the required authorization and token URLs automatically based on the given _Client ID_, _Client Secret_, and _Tenant URL_. You can still use the respective options to provide values for the authorization URL and token URL to override the calculated values.

### Changed

- Generic options are hidden for all commands. Before, all options where shown, including generic options applicable to any command.

  ```bash
  $ datasphere spaces read --help
  Usage: datasphere spaces read [options]
  fetch space details for a specified space
  Options:
    -V, --verbose                    print detailed log information to console (optional)
    -O, --options-file <file>        path to options file (optional)
    -H, --host <host>                specifies the url where the tenant is hosted (optional)
    -c, --client-id <id>             client id for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -C, --client-secret <secret>     client secret for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -a, --access-token <token>       access token for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -r, --refresh-token <token>      refresh token for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -b, --code <code>                code for oauth token retrieval (optional)
    -t, --token-url <url>            token url for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -A, --authorization-url <url>    authorization url for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -p, --passcode <passcode>        passcode for interactive session authentication (optional)
    -s, --secrets-file <file>        path to secrets file (optional)
    -e, --expires-in <expires>       expires in information for interactive oauth session authentication (optional)
    -o, --output <output>            specifies the file to store the output of the command (optional)
    -P, --pretty                     pretty-formats JSON responses (optional)
    -S, --space <space>              space ID (optional)
    -N, --no-space-definition        do not read space definition (optional)
    -m, --definitions [definitions]  read definitions (optional)
    -q, --connections [connections]  read connections (optional)
    -h, --help                       display help for command
  ```

  Now, only command-specific options are shown.

  ```bash
  $ datasphere spaces read --help
  Usage: datasphere spaces read [options]
  fetch space details for a specified space
  Options:
  -S, --space <space> space ID (optional)
  -N, --no-space-definition do not read space definition (optional)
  -m, --definitions [definitions] read definitions (optional)
  -q, --connections [connections] read connections (optional)
  -h, --help display help for command
  Only command-specific options are listed here. To learn more about available generic options, visit https://your.generic.options.help.url
  ```

- Option `-P, --pretty` changes to `-n, --no-pretty`. You can now supply option `-n, --no-pretty` to not pretty-format the response of a command. By default, the response of a command is pretty-formatted. When adding the option `-h, --help` to any command, the help tells you about the possible uses.

  ```bash
  $ datasphere spaces read --help
  Usage: datasphere spaces read [options]

  fetch space details for a specified space

  Options:
    -n, --no-pretty       do not pretty-format JSON responses (optional)
    -h, --help            display help for command
  ```

  When calling a command that supports the `-P, --pretty` option you can explicitly specify to pretty-print the result.

  `$ datasphere spaces read --pretty true`

  To disable pretty-printing, set `-P, --pretty` to `false`.

  `$ datasphere spaces read --pretty false`

  Calling a command without specifying the `-P, --pretty` option explicitly yields the same output as when calling the command with `--pretty true`.

- A new top-level command `config` has been introduced. This command groups all the CLI configuration-related commands such as `cache`, `secrets`, `host`, ...

    tasks [options]            manage tasks
  ```

- The environment variable `DWC_CLI_PORT` changed to `CLI_HTTP_PORT`.

### Fixed

- Values entered for the _Authorization URL_ and _Token URL_ could be entered including query parameters like `https://some.authorization.url?some.parameter=some.value`. The CLI did not remove the query parameters when using the URLs to retrieve the temporary code. This has been changed, the query parameters are now removed. The CLI changes an URL from `https://some.authorization.url?some.parameter=some.value` to `https://some.authorization.url` to retrieve the temporary code.

## 2023.10.0

Package `@sap/datasphere-cli` was released.
